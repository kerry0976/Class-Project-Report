Hello, 

Here I showcase some of the final projects I've done in the past. It was a good learning experience even though they are not my primary research subjects. 

Here is the list:

# California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo #

##1) Propulsion - taught by Piyush M Mehta##

   **Investigation of Minimum Length of Supersonic 2D Nozzle Design Using the Method of Characteristics**
   
   *Summary: Using Method of Characteristics to investiggate the minimum length of a supersonic 2D nozzle design.*

2) Macroeconomic Analysis taught by Michael Marlow  

   **An Analysis of the Exit Problem Facing the Fed from Quantitative Easing on Inflation**
   
   *Summary: An quantitative analysis of effect of the exit problem due to quantitative Easing.* 
   
# University of Minnesota Twin Cities

1) Robust Control - taught by Dale Enns 

   **Reusable Rocket Vertical Landing**
   
   *Summary: We use a vertical landing rocket as a study case to show how to analyze nominal stability (NS), nominal performance (NP),       robust stability (RS) and robust performance (RP) with designed controllers.* 
   
2) Convex Optimization Methods in Control - taught by Pete Seiler 

   **Modeling Additive Uncertainty in a longitudinal dynamic model using Convex Optimization techniques** 
   
   *Summary: Implementation of uncertainty modeling using conex optimization techniques.*
   
3) Navigation and Guidance System  - taught by Demoz Gebre-Egizabher 

   *Project*: **Relative Positioning Estimation using Double-Difference Carrier Phase Measurements with Integer Ambiguity                   Resolution**
   
   *Summary: Estmiating a static relative distance using double-difference carrier phase measurement was demonstrated. Different integer     ambiguity methods were compared.* 

4) Introduction to Nonlinear Optimization - taught by Mingyi Hong 

   **Estimating Aerodynamic Coefficients using Feed-forward Neural Network (FFNN)**
   
   *Summary: Implementing a FFNN in matlab to estimate longtindinal aerodynamic coefficient as a case study.* 
   
5) Sensing and State Estimation in Robotics - taught by Stergios Roumeliotis

   **2D SLAM Navigation Robot**
   
   *Summary: We implmented a 2D SLAM Kalman filter based algorithm on a Pionner P3-DX robot with a SICK laser scanner.*
   
6) Artficial Intelligence II - taught by Paul R. Schrater

   **Autonomous Wildfire Surveillance using Reinforcement Learning**
   
   *Summary: We study how to navigate fixed-wing aircraft autonomously in a simulated environment to maximize forest fire coverage using     Q-learning.* 
   
7) Sparse Matrix Computation - taught by Yousef Saad 

   **Sparse Dictionary Learning: Algorithm Comparison and Challenges**
   
   *Summary: In this presentation, various sparse dictionary learning methods are discussed and compared.*
   
8) Advanced Control System Design with Applications to Smart Vehicles - taught by Rajesh Rajamani

   **Driver Comparison using Intelligent Driver Model**
   
   *Summary: Driver behaviors were investigated using an Intelligent Driver Model. Three scenarios were implemented: mild lane-changing,     critical lane-changing, and Platooning in changing traffic states.*
